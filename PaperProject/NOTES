Functions in mind:
-------------
- Backup of DB
  Export of remote DBs to json files is now possible. Perhaps also look into how remote DBs 
  can be replicated or howto autmatically backup some of the files on the remote DBs.
  Possibilty to compress and E-mail backup files to administrator.  

- Having CouchDB and the nodemailer on a public net requires TLS/SSH.
  CouchDB 2.0 has been executeed on a Raspberry Pi 3 (Rasbian) and on local host (Windows 7)
  Nodemailer has been executes on Local host (Wndows 7)
     
- Running without connection
  Possiblity to read data from local PouchDB only when CouchDB is not available?
   
- Summing up the orders and display result dynamically on top of page "Beställningar".
